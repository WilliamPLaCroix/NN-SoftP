Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /var/lib/condor/execute/dir_37448/matplotlib-o4s7hx8y because the default path (/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
